            <h3 class="text-head"> Canada welcomes more than 100,000 immigrants through family sponsorship each year.</h3>

This comprehensive CanadaVisa page provides an overview on how to sponsor your family for immigration to Canada.</p>

            <h2 class="text-head">Overview of Canadian Immigration Family Sponsorship</h2>
            <p>Family reunification is one of the pillars of Canada's immigration system. Since the end of the Second World War, Canada has sought to welcome immigrants to strengthen its economy, bring families together, and on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. The family class is the second largest category of newcomers welcomed by Canada under its <a class="text-link" href=""> Immigration Levels Plan </a>. Canada is pursuing the highest levels of immigration in its history to support its post-COVID economic recovery. As such, Canada aims to welcome over 400,000 new immigrants per year, of which, over 100,000 immigrants per year fall under the family class.</p>
            <p>The country's immigration system is managed by the Department of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada or IRCC for short. The department was previously known as Citizenship and Immigration Canada, or CIC for short. IRCC establishes and administers Canada's family sponsorship program. This entails establishing program criteria, accepting and reviewing family sponsorship applications, and providing permanent and temporary resident visas.</p>
            <p>What is Canadian family sponsorship?</p>
            <p>There are two main aspects to sponsorship:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>It allows your family member to immigrate to Canada and get permanent residence (PR).</li>
                <li>It requires you, as an individual, to make a commitment to provide for basic needs and to support that person financially.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>How is COVID-19 impacting family sponsorship?</p>
            <p>Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) is still accepting family sponsorship applications.</p>
            <p>While the processing of sponsorship applications has been affected by the coronavirus pandemic, the Canadian government continues to look for innovative and compassionate ways to reunite families.</p>
            <p>Here are some of the steps that have been taken:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>IRCC has increased the number of staff who will review spousal sponsorship applications by 66% to reduce wait times and process applications more quickly. </li>
                <li>IRCC is also implementing a pilot project that will use new technology to digitize paper applications for faster processing. </li>
                <li>IRCC has indicated that it may implement biometric facilitation measures and introduce technology to conduct interviews with applicants remotely. </li>
                <li>If you received Employment Insurance and Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), you can still sponsor your spouse, parent, grandparent, child or other family member as long as you meet all the requirements to be a sponsor. </li>
                <li>If the person you have sponsored received Employment Insurance (EI) or CERB during the undertaking period, this will not cause you to have to default on your obligations. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Can I be a sponsor?</h3>
            <p>To sponsor a family member, you are required to meet several requirements such as being:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>    a Canadian citizen or permanent resident of Canada </li>
                <li>    18 years of age or older </li>
                <li>    able to support the sponsored person for several years </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Who can I sponsor?</p>        
            <ul>
                <li>    Spouses and common-law partners </li>
                <li>    Dependent children </li>
                <li>    Parents and grandparents </li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are exceptions to this rule, however, and it may be possible to sponsor a non-immediate family member (for example, a sister, niece, or uncle) if: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>you do not have any other immediate family members you could sponsor, or</li>
                <li>you have legally adopted them and they meet the definition of a dependent child.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What are the income requirements to sponsor?</p>
            <p>As a sponsor, you are required to sign a Sponsorship Agreement with your sponsored family member. This is a commitment by you to provide financial support for the basic needs (food, clothing, shelter, and health needs not covered by public health services) of the person you are sponsoring.</p>
            <p>For some types of sponsorships, you will also have to meet or exceed the <a class="text-link" href=""> Low Income Cut-off (LICO)</a>, for instance if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>you are sponsoring a spouse or partner who has a dependent child and that dependent child has one or more children of their own, or </li>
                <li>you are sponsoring a dependent child who has one or more dependent children of their own, or </li>
                <li>you are sponsoring a parent or grandparent.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="text-head">Sponsor your Wife, Husband, or Common-law Partner</h2>
            <a class="text-link" href=""><h3 >Spouse or Common Law-Partner Sponsorship</h3> </a> 
            <p><b> If you are a Canadian citizen or permanent resident of Canada you may sponsor: </b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>your spouse (you are legally married) </li>
                <li>common-law partner (you are not legally married but have been living together for at least 12 months in a conjugal relationship). </li>
                <li>conjugal partner (you are not legally married or in a common-law relationship and they are living outside Canada) </li>

            </ul>
            <p><b> To be eligible for spousal or common-law partner sponsorship, you must:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li> be 18 year of age, a Canadian permanent resident living in Canada or Canadian citizen,</li>
                <li> demonstrate that you can provide for the basic needs for yourself and your spouse or partner,</li>
                <li> Prove your relationship with the sponsored person is genuine by providing supporting documentation.</li>

            </ul>
            <p><b> To be eligible for spousal or common-law partner sponsorship, the sponsored person must:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>be at least 18 years of age and not too closely related to you.</li>

            <a class="stu-canvisa-link" href="">Find out if you are eligible to sponsor your partner</a>
            <p><b>There are two types of spousal or common-law sponsorship applications:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li> <a class="text-link" href="">Inland:</a> The application can be made from within Canada because the person you wish to sponsor is currently in Canada. This type of sponsorship allows applicants to continue to live in Canada while their application for permanent residence is being processed.    </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the application is made from within Canada, the person you are sponsoring may apply for an <a class="text-link" href=""> open work permit </a>that would allow them to work for any employer in Canada while the sponsorship application is being processed.</p>
            <p>It is possible for spouses or partners to come to Canada by first applying for a <a class="text-link" href=""> Temporary Resident Visa (TRV). </a></p>
            <ul>
                <li> <a class="text-link" href="">Outland:</a> The application is made from abroad through an Embassy or Consulate.    </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this case, the person you are sponsoring and who resides abroad will normally wait for permanent residence outside of the country but may visit you in Canada.</p>
