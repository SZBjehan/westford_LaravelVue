            <h3>Overview and COVID-19</h3>
            If you want to immigrate to Canada then you’ve come to the right place. Westford Immigration servieces will help you figure out how you can make your Canada dream come true.
<br><br>People choose to immigrate to Canada for many reasons. Whether it’s to pursue a high-quality education, to feel secure with free universal healthcare, or to benefit from Canada’s high quality of life, Canada’s got it all.
<br><br>There are over 100 different ways to immigrate to Canada. For that reason, everyone’s path to Canadian immigration will be unique.
<br><br>For example, there are many different ways for professionals and workers to qualify for a Canada Immigration permanent resident visa. The most prominent option is through Express Entry, which is Canada's main pathway for economic class skilled workers. Your best bet to be eligible under Express Entry is to meet the requirements of either the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) or Canadian Experience Class (CEC). Canada's second largest pathway for skilled workers is the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP). Nearly every province and territory operates the PNP so they can select immigrants that meet the needs of their local job markets. The third major option is immigrating to the province of Quebec, which operates notable pathways such as the Quebec Skilled Worker Program and the Quebec Experience Class. 
<br><br>If you want to obtain Canadian permanent residence as a business immigrant, you have a number of options such as the Federal Self-Employed Program, the Start-up Visa, and entrepreneur programs operated under the PNP and by Quebec.
<br><br>Canada offers a number of family class sponsorship programs. Through these programs, Canadian citizens and permanent residents may sponsor family members and loved ones for Canadian immigration.
            <h3>COVID-19: Impact on Canada's Immigration System</h3>
            The global coronavirus pandemic is impacting Canada's immigration system. Nonetheless, since the start of the pandemic, the Canadian government has maintained a strong commitment to processing immigration applications to the best of its ability. The department of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) continues to welcome new immigration applications and is processing as many of them as it can so that immigrants can come to Canada during and after the pandemic. Express Entry draws continue to occur approximately every two weeks with candidates all over the world receiving permanent residence invitations.
<br><br>Moreover, the pandemic has led to Canada strengthening its commitment to immigration. Near the end of 2020, Canada announced it will increase its annual immigration target to over 400,000 new immigrants per year, which is the highest level in its history. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Canada's target was over 340,000 new immigrants per year. At the beginning of 2021, Canada's Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino expressed confidence that these high immigration targets are realistic during the pandemic.

            <h3><b> Why Does Canada Need Immigrants? </b></h3>
            Canada welcomes immigrants under three classes: the economic class, family class, and refugee and humanitarian class.
<br><br>Skilled workers are welcomed under the economic class to support Canada’s high living standards. Canada has an aging population and low birth rate which is why most of the immigrants it welcomes are skilled workers. Canada needs these skilled workers to support its labour force and economic growth. These skilled workers arrive with strong language skills, work experience, and education, and desire to succeed. Hence, they play a vital role in Canada’s efforts to support economic growth and social services such as education and universal health care.
<br><br>The second largest immigrant class arrives through family sponsorship. Canada welcomes the loved ones of Canadian citizens and permanent residents since strong families are the bedrock of Canada’s society and economy. Allowing close family members to build a life in Canada provides families with the emotional support they need to thrive in the country’s society and economy.
<br><br>The third largest class are welcomed as refugees and for humanitarian purposes. As one of the world’s most privileged nations, Canada has a moral obligation to provide safety to those fleeing persecution and other hardship, and Canada has a long tradition since the end of the Second World War of demonstrating humanitarian leadership. In 1986, the United Nations awarded the people of Canada the Nansen Medal, which is the UN's highest honour for those who demonstrate excellence in helping refugees. Canada remains the first and only country to receive the Nansen Medal.
            <h3><b> Skilled Worker Immigration Pathways </b></h3>
            <p>Under its Immigration Levels Plan, Canada aims to welcome over 400,000 immigrants every year. Some 60 per cent of these immigrants arrive as skilled workers. The main way skilled workers can immigrate to Canada is through the Express Entry application management system. The second main way is through the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP), followed by Quebec’s skilled worker programs, and then a few other targeted federal programs.</p>
            <p><b>Skilled Workers Can Move to Canada with their Family</b></p>
            Skilled workers can also bring close family members with them to Canada with permanent resident status. 
<br><br> Close family members include:
            <ul>
                <li>your spouse or common-law partner </li>
                <li>dependent children </li>
                <li>dependent children of your spouse or common-law partner </li>
                <li>dependent children of dependent children </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Dependent children are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP)</li>
                <li>Canadian Experience Class (CEC)</li>
                <li>Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP) </li>
            </ul>
            Candidates who are eligible for Express Entry can upload their profile onto the federal government’s website.
<br><br>Candidates receive a Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score based on criteria such as their age, education, language skills, and work experience etc.
<br><br>Approximately every two weeks, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) invites candidates with the highest CRS scores to apply for permanent residence.
<br><br>IRCC aims to process permanent residence applications in six months or less.
<br><br>Under its Immigration Levels Plan, Canada seeks to welcome an average of 110,000 immigrants through Express Entry each year.
            <a href=""><h3 class="stu-canvisa-link text-cent">Find out more about Express Entry</h3> </a>
            <h3><b>Provincial Nominee Program (PNP)</b></h3>
            Through the Provincial Nominee Programs (PNP), Canada’s provinces and territories can nominate people who wish to immigrate to Canada and reside in a particular province. Canada seeks to welcome over 80,000 immigrants per year under the PNP.
<br><br>All provinces and territories, except for Quebec and Nunavut, has its own PNP. Each province determines its own criteria for choosing eligible candidates. PNPs operate Expression of Interest (EOI) systems, similar to Express Entry, and invite the candidates in regular draws.
<br><br>You do not need to have an Express Entry profile to apply. You can apply directly to a PNP stream. These are called ‘base’ streams.
<br><br>You can also apply to PNP streams that are aligned with Express Entry. These are called ‘enhanced’ streams. The benefit of applying to an enhanced stream is that it gives you more options.
<br><br>Receiving a provincial nomination through these streams awards Express Entry candidates an additional 600 Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) points. This practically guarantees receiving an invitation to apply for permanent residence in a subsequent Express Entry draw.
            <a href=""><h3 class="stu-canvisa-link text-cent">Learn more about the PNP</h3> </a>
            <h3><b>Atlantic Immigration Pilot</b></h3>
            <p>Atlantic Canada has its own immigration program called the Atlantic Immigration Pilot (AIP). The AIP is a fast-track immigration program that allows employers to attract and retain foreign talent. Atlantic Canada includes four provinces:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>New Brunswick </li>
                <li>Newfoundland and Labrador </li>
                <li>Nova Scotia </li>
                <li>Prince Edward Island </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Employers who wish to benefit from the AIP must find a suitable candidate and offer them a job. They do not need to conduct a Labour Market Impact Assessment. Once the candidate accepts the offer, the employer must connect the candidate with a designated organization that will help him or her develop a settlement plan. Employers who wish to quickly fill the position may also have access to a temporary work permit.</p>
            <p>The AIP is divided into three programs. Two of these programs are aimed at skilled workers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Atlantic High-Skilled Program (AHSP) </li>
                <li>Atlantic Intermediate-Skilled Program (AISP) </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The third program is aimed at international graduates:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Atlantic International Graduate Program (AIGP)</li>
            </ul>
            <a href=""><h3 class="stu-canvisa-link text-cent">Read More on the AIP</h3> </a>
            <h3><b>Other Federal Skilled Worker Programs</b></h3>
            <p>Additional targeted federal skilled worker programs exist that help certain immigration candidates gain permanent residence. The additional federal programs include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot (RNIP) </li>
                <li>Agri-Food Immigration Pilot</li>
                <li>Live-in Caregiver Program (LCP) </li>
                <li>Home Child Care Provider Pilot </li>
                <li>Home Support Worker Pilot </li>
            </ul>
            The RNIP allows small and remote communities across Canada to attract and retain foreign workers. Participating communities take the lead in attracting new immigrants and matching them with suitable jobs. 
<br><br>The Agri-Food Immigration Pilot provides a pathway to Canadian permanent residence to eligible temporary foreign workers in the Agriculture and Agri-Food industry. In order to be eligible, candidates need to have completed 12 months of work experience, hold a high school diploma and meet minimum language requirements.
<br><br>The remaining three immigration programs provide pathways to permanent residence for foreign caregivers, including live-in caregivers, childcare providers and home support workers. For all three programs, candidates are required to have at least two years of work experience relevant to the program they are applying for. 
            <h3><b>Business Immigration</b></h3>
            Business people have several options that may allow you to fast-track the Canadian immigration process.
<br><br>For example, you may be able to immigrate to Canada through the Federal Start-Up Visa Program, or the Federal Self-Employed Persons Program.

            <h3><b>Moving to Canada from the U.S.</b></h3>
            If you are a U.S. citizens or resident, you have plenty of options to consider if you wish to live in Canada. Many move north to Canada from the U.S. each year to work, study or immigrate. Learn how you can be among them by visiting our dedicated page for those in the U.S.
<br><br>Candidates who wish to work in Canada can choose between various options depending on their situation. For example, there is a facilitated process to help U.S. citizens work in Canada temporarily under the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) which is formerly known as NAFTA. The agreement also helps with intra-company transfers as well as CUSMA traders and investors.
<br><br>Candidates who have a spouse or common-law partner in the U.S. may sponsor them to come to Canada. In addition, U.S. citizens and residents have many options if they wish to immigrate to Canada to start a new business or purchase an already existing business.

            <h3><b>Family Class Sponsorship</b></h3>
            The Canadian government is committed to keeping families together. As such, Canada aims to welcome over 100,000 new immigrants every year to join their family. 
<br><br>Canadian citizens and permanent residents can sponsor their spouses or common-law partners, parents and grandparents, and dependent children.
<br><br>You will need to sign an 'undertaking' in order to sponsor your family. This means that you will be financially responsible for the person you will sponsor. For example, if they require social assistance, you may have to pay it back.
<br><br>For parents and grandparents, there is also the Super Visa program option.

            Canada values your education and work experience and takes it into consideration for many of its Canadian immigration programs. There are many immigration programs that you may be eligible for. Many of these programs assign a point value for your education. You may receive more points if you have an advanced degree such as a Master’s or a PhD.
<br><br>Candidates for Canadian immigration who have at least one year of skilled work experience are deemed more likely to be able to integrate into the Canadian labour market. Once again, many programs assign a point value for your work experience. You may receive additional points for more work experience, depending on the program.

            <p><b>5. What is the best age to immigrate to Canada?</b></p>
            It depends on the pathway you are applying under. Express Entry is Canada's main skilled worker pathway. Under the Express Entry system, the best age to immigrate to Canada is between 20 and 29 years old. This provides you with 100 Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) points, if you are applying with a spouse, and 110 CRS points if you are applying on your own. You may still receive points for your age if you are not within this age group. For example, if you are 35 years old, you can receive between 70 and 77 points.
<br><br> Keep in mind that while age is an important selection criteria, it is among other important selection criteria that Canada's federal and provincial governments consider when selecting skilled workers. You can also receive significant points for your education, work experience, language skills, a job offer, and Canadian experience. Hence, even if you are unable to obtain the maximum number of points for your age under a given federal or provincial skilled worker program, there are other ways for you to gain the points you need to successfully immigrate to Canada. One strategy you can pursue is having your spouse or partner (if you have one) as the principal applicant in your application if they score higher than you. Visit this page to learn how you can maximize your Express Entry CRS score.
            <p><b>6. What is Express Entry?</b></p>
            <p>Express Entry is the Canadian federal government’s application management system. It manages permanent residence applications through Canada’s three main economic class immigration programs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) </li>
                <li>The Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP) </li>
                <li>The Canadian Experience Class (CEC)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Canada aims to welcome an average of 110,000 immigrants through Express Entry each year which is over one-quarter of the some 400,000 new immigrants Canada seeks to welcome annually.</p>
            <p><b>7. What is the CRS in Canada?</b></p>
            <p>CRS stands for Comprehensive Ranking System. The CRS is the point system that ranks eligible candidates through Express Entry. Candidates are ranked based on multiple factors such as their age, work experience, education, language proficiency as well as adaptability.</p>
            <p><b>8. Do I need a job offer for Express Entry?</b></p>
            No, you do not need a job offer to submit your Express Entry profile. The vast majority of candidates who succeed under Express Entry do not have a job offer. However, a job offer may increase your chances of receiving an invitation to apply for permanent residence. This is because a job offer, awards you additional CRS points.
<br><br> If you are eligible for the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) or the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP), and you do not have the required settlement funds to support yourself, you will need to have a job offer.
            <p><b>9. How do I create an Express Entry profile?</b></p>
            <p>The first step is for you to fill out the online form on the website of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada. If you are eligible, you will be redirected to create your Express Entry profile, where you will be prompted to provide details regarding:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your passport or travel document </li>
                <li>Your Educational Credential Assessment (ECA) </li>
                <li>Your language test results </li>
                <li>Your proof of funds </li>
                <li>Your job offer in Canada (if you have one) </li>
                <li>Your provincial nomination (if you have one) </li>

            </ul>
            <p><b>10. I am currently studying in Canada. Can I become a permanent resident?</b></p>
            Yes, there are many options for you to pursue. Former international students are becoming a growing share of those who become new immigrants in Canada.
<br><br> Commonly, you will need to have one year of Canadian work experience but this is not always the case (e.g., if you have eligible foreign work experience, you may not need Canadian work experience to be eligible for a skilled worker program). Visit this page to see the many immigration pathways available to international students.
            <p><b>11. How can I immigrate to Canada through the PNP?</b></p>
            In order to immigrate to Canada through the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP), you will need a Canadian provincial or territorial government to nominate you.
<br><br>To get started, you will need to apply directly to the province or territory you are interested in immigrating to. You will then be assessed based on various factors such as your education and work experience. If you meet the province or territory’s labour needs, you may be invited to apply for a provincial nomination.
<br><br>Once approved, you will be able to apply for Canadian permanent residence.

            <p><b>17. How can I sponsor my husband, wife or partner to come to Canada?</b></p>
            <p>The first step is to ensure you and your spouse or partner meet the eligibility criteria.</p>
            <p>If you do, you need to prepare and submit two applications: one for sponsorship and one for permanent residence. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) aims to make a decision on spousal sponsorship applications within 12 months. </p>

            <p><b>18. How can I sponsor my parents or grandparents to come to Canada?</b></p>
            If you wish to sponsor your parents or grandparents to come to Canada as permanent residents, you must submit an interest to sponsor form during the period it is available.
<br><br>Once the form closes, Canada randomly selects potential sponsors and invite them to apply to sponsor their parents and/or grandparents.
<br><br>If you are invited to apply, you must submit your application by the deadline mentioned in the invitation.
<br><br>Another option is to apply for Parent and Grandparent Super Visa. This visa type allows parents and grandparents of Canadian citizens and permanent residents to visit Canada for up to two years. This multiple-entry visa can remain valid for up to 10 years.
            <p><b>19. How can I sponsor my children to come to Canada?</b></p>
            Canadian citizens and permanent residents who wish to bring their dependent children to Canada must first prove their relationship with the child, whether or not the child is biological or adopted.
<br><br> The sponsor must be over 18 years old to be able to sponsor. The sponsored child must be under 22 years old, unless they are financially dependent on the sponsor, and are unable to become financially dependent because of a physical or mental condition.
            <p><b>21. Who can sponsor me in Canada?</b></p>
            <p>Canadian citizens and permanent residents are eligible to sponsor family members including their wife, husband, partner, dependent children, parents, grandparents, and in some cases, other family members.</p>
        
            <p><b>22. Is it difficult to immigrate to Canada?</b></p>
            It is not difficult to immigrate to Canada as long as you meet the eligibility criteria of a program that is the right fit for you.
<br><br>Consider that Canada seeks to welcome over 400,000 new immigrants per year under its economic, family, and refugee classes. Canada operates over 100 different skilled worker programs under the economic class and some 60 per cent of all new immigrants arrive under the economic class. Hence, skilled workers overseas have a lot of options to choose from.
<br><br>In addition, Canada welcomes family members including wives, husbands, partners, dependent children, parents, grandparents, and other close loved ones. As long as you and the Canadian citizen or permanent resident sponsoring you meet Canada's eligibility criteria, you will be able to immigrate to Canada.
<br><br>Canada is committed to operating a successful immigration system which is why it dedicates a lot of government resources to making the immigration application process as smooth as possible.

            <p><b>24. Can I go to Canada without a job offer?</b></p>
            <p>Yes, you can immigrate to Canada as a skilled worker without a job offer, however having an eligible job offer does help. Nonetheless, the majority of successful immigrants under Express Entry do not have a job offer. Having an eligible job offer under Express Entry will get you extra points but it does not guarantee you will receive a permanent residence invitation. As long as you meet the eligibility criteria of at least one of Canada's over 100 different skilled worker programs, and receive a high score for your human capital such as your age, education, language skills, and work experience, you have a chance to successfully immigrate to Canada without a job offer. </p>
            <p><b>26. Can I immigrate to Canada at the age of 55?</b></p>
            <p>Yes you can. While age is an important selection criteria, it is one of several other major factors that Canada's skilled worker and business immigration programs consider. The programs also consider your education, language skills, work experience, Canadian experience, whether you have an eligible job offer, and in the case of business programs, your business experience, net worth, and amount of money you want to invest in Canada. </p>
            <p><b>29. Is healthcare free in Canada?</b></p>
            <p>Yes, universal healthcare is available to Canadian citizens and permanent residents. Healthcare eligibility for new permanent residents depends on the province or territory you are landing in. Visit the following CanadaVisa page to learn about free healthcare coverage provided by each jurisdiction in Canada. Note that some provinces require new permanent residents live there for a few months before they can obtain free healthcare coverage which means you may need private health insurance during this waiting period. </p>
