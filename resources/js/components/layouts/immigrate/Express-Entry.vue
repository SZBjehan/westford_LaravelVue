            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <h3 class="text-head">1. What is Express Entry?</h3>
            <br>
            Express Entry is an electronic system used to manage the applications of skilled workers who wish to become permanent residents of Canada.
<br><br>Once an interested candidate submits an online profile, the federal government determines if the candidate is eligible for a program managed by Express Entry. Eligible candidates are accepted into the Express Entry pool and are ranked according to the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). The CRS is a points-based system used by the government to assess and rank candidates in the Express Entry pool. The CRS score is calculated based on a candidate’s age, education, work experience, language skills, as well as other factors.
<br><br>Approximately every two weeks, the Canadian government selects the highest-scoring candidates from the Express Entry pool and provides them with an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence.

            <h3 class="text-head">How is COVID-19 impacting Express Entry?</h3>
            Canada is holding Express Entry draws regularly throughout the coronavirus pandemic and is inviting the highest levels of immigrants since Express Entry was launched in 2015.
<br><br>Canada exceeded its Express Entry invitation target in 2020 due to its steadfast commitment to immigration. Canada needs high levels of skilled workers to build a new life in the country to support a healthy economy and society.
<br><br>Express Entry immigration is set to grow even further in 2021, 2022, and 2023. In late-2020, Canada released a historic 2021-2023 Immigration Levels Plan. The plan calls for the highest levels of immigration in Canadian history as the country will aim to welcome over 400,000 new immigrants per year. Most of these new immigrants will arrive as skilled workers, with Express Entry being the main way that Canada will manage their applications. In 2021, 2022, and 2023, Canada will aim to welcome around 110,000 Express Entry immigrants each year.

            <h3 class="text-head">3. How can I apply for Express Entry</h3>
            <p>Answer TBA</p>
            <h3 class="text-head">4. How long does the Express Entry process take?</h3>
            <p>An Express Entry profile can be valid for up to one year. Candidates who receive an ITA can expect the Canadian government to process their permanent residence applications within six months. The government begins to measure the processing time when a complete permanent residence application is received. The processing time ends when a final decision is made on the application. If a candidate does not receive an ITA within one year of creating their Express Entry profile, they can simply re-submit their profile if they are still eligible.</p>
            <h3 class="text-head">5. Why Do I need a consultant for Express Entry?</h3>
            You do not need to hire a lawyer to go through the Express Entry process but it can be beneficial for you to do so.
<br><br>An experienced, professional, and trustworthy Canadian immigration lawyer can maximize your chances of succeeding under Express Entry for a modest legal fee.
<br><br>They can provide you with guidance on how to obtain the maximum number of Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) points, and walk you through the Express Entry process, from submitting your profile, to preparing your permanent residence application after you have received an invitation to apply (ITA) for permanent residence. In addition, it is a lawyer's job to ensure that you do not make mistakes or misrepresent your Canadian immigration application.
<br><br>The Law Firm of Campbell Cohen is authorized by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to represent immigration candidates in the Express Entry process. Campbell Cohen has 45 years of experience supporting skilled workers in immigrating to Canada. Campbell Cohen is retained by a large number of Express Entry candidates each year who trust Campbell Cohen with submitting the strongest Express Entry profile possible and securing a permanent resident visa after receiving an ITA.
            <h3 class="text-head">6. Should I enter the Express Entry pool if I have a low CRS?</h3>
            <p>Entering the Express Entry pool if you are eligible is beneficial for you since it increases your chances of successfully immigrating to Canada:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>First, as mentioned above, it is free to enter the Express Entry pool. You incur some costs before entering the pool for your language test and ECA, but these are costs you will need to incur for the majority of Canadian immigration programs you wish to apply to. </li>
                <li>Express Entry CRS cut-off scores are always fluctuating and are impossible to predict. What may seem like a low CRS score could be enough to eventually secure an invitation to apply for permanent residence. </li>
                <li>While you are in the Express Entry pool, you can work on improving your CRS score such as by retaking your language test, gaining more eligible professional work experience and/or education, or working and studying in Canada. </li>
                <li>While in the pool you may obtain an invitation to apply for a provincial nomination which will essentially guarantee you will receive an invitation to apply (ITA) for a Canadian permanent resident visa. </li>
                <li>You may also receive a Canada job offer while in the pool which may give you a high enough CRS score to obtain an ITA for permanent residence. </li>
                <li>You can apply directly to other Canadian immigration programs while you are in the Express Entry pool. </li>  
            </ul>
            <h3 class="text-head">7. What is the difference between Express Entry and the PNP?</h3>
            In Canada, the federal government and provinces and territories can operate their own immigration programs. However, the federal government makes the final decision on whether a candidate can obtain permanent residence.
<br><br>Express Entry manages three of the numerous economic immigration programs operated by the federal government.
<br><br>The Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) allows provinces and territories to signal to the federal government that an immigration candidate meets the economic needs of their region. Such candidates obtain a provincial nomination which they can use to support their permanent residence application submitted to the federal government.
<br><br>A provincial nomination is the single most valuable factor under Express Entry’s CRS and results in an Express Entry candidate receiving an additional 600 points towards their CRS score, which essentially guarantees they will receive an ITA.
<br><br>Even if an Express Entry candidate does not initially have a high enough ranking score to receive an ITA from the federal government, they may obtain a nomination from a province or territory through Express Entry, increase their CRS score by 600 points, and then obtain an ITA from the federal government during the next draw from the Express Entry pool.
            <h3 class="text-head">8. How can I find out my NOC code for Express Entry?</h3>
            <p>Answer TBA</p>
            <h3 class="text-head">9. Do I need a Canada job offer under Express Entry? </h3>
            <p>No, you do not need a job offer to be successful under Express Entry. Obtaining a job offer does not guarantee you will succeed, however it will help to increase your Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score. You can obtain either 50 or 200 additional CRS points if you receive a job offer that is eligible under Express Entry.</p>
            <h3 class="text-head">10. Do Express Entry immigrants find good jobs in Canada? </h3>
            <p>Yes. A 2020 study completed by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) finds that Express Entry immigrants are very successful in Canada's job market since they have the human capital characteristics that are desired by Canada's employers. The study finds that Express Entry immigrants tend to earn higher salaries than the average Canadian worker and have high rates of employment and low rates of unemployment. Express Entry immigrants are expected to continue to do well in the Canadian job market since their skills will remain in high demand by Canadian employers as more workers retire over the coming decade. Canada relies on immigration to alleviate the economic and fiscal challenges that are caused by its rapidly aging population and low birth rate.</p>
            <h3 class="text-head">11. Can my family come with me under Express Entry?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Under Express Entry, you can include your wife, husband, or common-law partner. In addition, you can include your dependent children, your spouse or common-law partner's dependent children, and the dependent children of dependent children. If you are successful under Express Entry, your accompanying family members will also receive permanent residence. </p>
            <p> Dependent children are defined as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>being under 22 years old and is not a spouse or common law partner</li>
                <li>being 22 years of age or older, relied on the financial support of their parents before the age of 22, and cannot support themselves financially because of a physical or mental health condition </li>
            </ul>
