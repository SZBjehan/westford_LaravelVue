            <h2>Canada Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot</h2>
            <p>Through the Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot, the Government of Canada works with small and remote communities in Ontario, Western Canada and the three territories to attract and retain foreign workers. </p>
            <p>The Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot (RNIP) is community-driven, which means participating communities take the lead in attracting new immigrants and matching them with local job vacancies, promoting a welcoming community, and connecting newcomers to established members of the community and local settlement services. </p>
            <h3 class="text-head">Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot — Participating Communities</h3>

            <p>Additionally, the job offer must be of the same skill level or one skill level above or below the NOC that best applies to the candidate’s work experience. Candidates whose NOC is rated skill level D, however, must have a job offer in the same occupation.</p>
            <h3><b>Language Requirements</b></h3>
            <p>The minimum language requirement is based on the NOC skill type or level that applies to the candidate’s job offer.</p>

            <ul>
