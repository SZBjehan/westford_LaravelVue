            <h2>4,500 CEC candidates invited in Express Entry draw</h2>

            Canada invited a total of 4,500 immigration candidates to apply for permanent residence in the latest Express Entry draw.
        <br><br>The draw took place on July 8. Only Canadian Experience Class (CEC) candidates were invited. The CEC is a program aimed at individuals who have at least one year of work experience in Canada. 
        <br><br>The minimum required Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score for this draw was 369, an increase of 12 points from the last CEC-only draw. This is also the smallest draw since May 20.
        <br><br>A day earlier, Canada invited 627 Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) candidates to apply for permanent residence. The PNP allows Canadian provinces to select and nominate candidates for permanent residence.
        <br><br>Invited candidates must have had a CRS score of at least 760. Provincial nominees get an extra 600 points, which means that they must have had just 160 core points.
        <br><br>Ever since Canada introduced temporary travel restrictions in March 2020 to slow the spread of COVID-19, most Express Entry draws were program-specific.

            <p> Canada uses the Express Entry system to manage permanent residence applications through the three main economic-class programs </p>
            <ul>
                <li>the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) </li>
                <li>the Federal Skilled Trades Class (FSTC) and </li>
                <li>the Canadian Experience Class (CEC).</li>
            </ul>
            In addition, all provinces and territories except Quebec and Nunavut have their own immigration programs, and many are aligned with Express Entry.
<br><br>Immigration candidates in the Express Entry system are given a CRS score, based on factors like their age, work experience, education, and their proficiency in French or English.
<br><br>The highest-scoring candidates in the Express Entry pool are regularly invited to apply for permanent residence.
<br><br>After receiving an invitation, candidates are required to submit their applications, after which Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) make a final decision. 
<br><br>If a candidate is successful, they will receive a Confirmation of Permanent Residence and a visa on their passport if they need one to enter Canada. After that, they would move to Canada and receive their Permanent Residence (PR) card.

            <h3>Canada inviting candidates already in the country</h3>
        In 2021, Canada has only held Express Entry draws that target candidates who are likely to be in Canada. This is in an effort to admit 401,000 new permanent residents this year.
<br><br>PNP candidates often need work experience, study experience or other connections to the province in order to receive a nomination. CEC candidates also need to have at least one year of Canadian work experience in order to be eligible.
<br><br>It is therefore likely that these candidates are currently residing in Canada.
<br><br>The country also aims to welcome over 400,000 immigrants in 2022 and in 2023.
<br><br>sCandidates outside Canada can still submit an Express Entry profile despite the COVID-related travel restrictions in place. IRCC continues to accept submissions to the Express Entry system, even from candidates who live overseas.

            <h2>Canada invites 627 PNP candidates in Express Entry draw</h2>
            Canada invited 627 candidates to apply for permanent residence in the last Express Entry draw on July 7.
<br><br>The minimum Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) needed to get an Invitation to Apply (ITA) was 760.
<br><br>Those who receive a nomination from a Canadian province get an extra 600 CRS points, which means they only needed 160 core points to be eligible for today's draw.
<br><br>Canada held many program-specific draws like this PNP-specific draw, since the country introduced travel restrictions in March 2020. There is light at the end of the tunnel though as Canada is slowly easing these restrictions.

            Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) uses the Express Entry system to manage applications for Canadian permanent residence through one of Canadaâ€™s three main economic-class programs: the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), the Federal Skilled Trades Class (FSTC) and the Canadian Experience Class (CEC).
<br><br>Canadian provinces and territories (except Quebec and Nunavut) have immigration programs that are aligned with the federal Express Entry system. 
<br><br>Candidates who create an Express Entry profile are given a CRS score. This score is based on your age, education, work experience, language proficiency as well as other factors.
<br><br>CRS points can be given to one person or to a couple if they are applying together. The highest-ranking candidates in the Express Entry pool are then invited to apply for permanent residence in an Express Entry draw. Usually, draws occur every two weeks. However, since Canada held program-specific draws, two draws are held one to two days apart, every two weeks.
<br><br>When a candidate receives an invitation to apply, they must submit their application to IRCC, who will then make a final decision. Canada aims to process most applications within six months. 
<br><br>Successful candidates receive a Confirmation of Permanent Residence (COPR) and a visa on your passport if you need one to enter Canada. 
<br><br>The last step would be to travel to Canada and receive your Permanent Residence (PR) card.
<br><br>Canada is committed to meeting its immigration targets this year and is looking to invite many more people to apply for permanent residence.
<br><br>In fact, Canada is looking to welcome over 400,000 immigrants every year between 2021 and 2023. 
<br><br>If you want to immigrate to Canada, you can still create an Express Entry profile. IRCC still continues to accept admissions to the Express Entry system, despite travel restrictions currently in place.

            <h2>How expired COPR holders can come to Canada</h2>
            Canada has released instructions for how those with expired Confirmation of Permanent Residence (COPR) can travel to Canada.
<br><br>Expired COPR holders need to renew their documents before they travel. They will not be allowed to travel to Canada with their expired documents. 
<br><br>Due to COVID-19-related travel restrictions, many COPR holders were not able to travel to Canada. This is because they were not exempt from the travel restrictions in place, until June 21, 2021.
<br><br>As they were waiting for the border to reopen to them, many saw their documents expire. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) have now released instructions for these people on what they need to do to come to Canada.
<br><br>A COPR is a document that Canada issues to those who have been approved to immigrate to Canada and become permanent residents.
<br><br>This means that a holder has met all the required criteria, paid their fees and passed health, security and criminality screenings.
<br><br>How to travel to Canada if your COPR is expired?
<br><br>IRCC says that it will contact those with expired COPRs by email. If you still want to immigrate to Canada, you will have to answer the email.
<br><br>You may then be asked to do a new medical exam and to provide updated information. If you don't respond, your file will be closed, which means that you will have to reapply if you want to come to Canada as a permanent resident in the future.
<br><br>According to IRCC, most people with expired COPRs that were issued on or before March 18, 2020 have been contacted.
<br><br>If you already received instructions to do a medical exam or to submit new documents, follow these instructions and wait to be contacted. You don't have to contact IRCC again.
<br><br>Usually, holders of expired COPRs would have to reapply for permanent residence. However, IRCC is making an exception for those who weren't able to travel because of the travel restrictions that were in place.

            <h3>What documents can Canada ask for?</h3>
            When IRCC contacts you by email, you will be asked about your family situation and if it has been changed. For example, if you got married, divorced, or had a new child.
<br><br>If there has been a change, IRCC will ask for relevant documents.
<br><br>If your previous documents were expired, such as police certificates and medical exams, you may be asked to submit updated documents.
            <h3>Canada easing requirements for fully vaccinated travellers</h3>
            Fully vaccinated travellers can travel to Canada without being subject to the quarantine requirement beginning July 5, 2021 at 11:59 p.m. EDT. This means that they will not have to stay at a government-approved hotel, and they will also not be required to take a COVID-19 test on day-8. 
<br><br>This includes approved permanent residents with valid COPR documents. 
<br><br>Fully vaccinated means that travellers must have received the full required number of doses (one or two depending on the vaccine), and must have received a vaccine that is approved by Health Canada. These include: Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Janssen.
<br><br>All travellers to Canada will still need to take a COVID-19 test before travelling to Canada, and upon arrival in Canada.
<br><br>Travellers can show a negative COVID-19 test administered within 72 hours before arriving in Canada, or show a positive COVID-19 test administered between 14 and 90 days prior to travelling to Canada.
<br><br>Vaccinated travellers have to submit their COVID-19 related information on the ArriveCAN mobile app.

            <h2>Ontario PNP draw invites Express Entry candidates</h2>
            Ontarioâ€™s latest provincial draw took place on June 23, 2021. The province invited immigration candidates who may qualify for Ontarioâ€™s Express Entry Human Capital Priorities stream.
<br><br>The Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP) invited immigration candidates who had an Express Entry profile and who were eligible under the province's Human Capital Priorities stream.
<br><br>A total of 583 immigration candidates were invited in this draw. Their Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score range was between 464 and 467.
<br><br>In order to be eligible to receive an invitation in this draw, invited candidates needed to show that they had work experience in one of 10 occupations.
<br><br>These occupations can be found below with their corresponding National Occupational Classification (NOC) number:
            <ul>
                <li>Banking, credit and other investment managers (NOC 0122) </li>
                <li>Advertising, marketing and public relations managers (NOC 0124) </li>
                <li>Other business services managers (NOC 0125) </li>
                <li>Corporate sales managers (NOC 0601) </li>
                <li>Financial auditors and accountants (NOC 1111) </li>
                <li>Financial and investment analysts (NOC 1112) </li>
                <li>Human resources professionals (NOC 1121) </li>
                <li>Professional occupations in business management consulting (NOC 1122) </li>
                <li>Registered nurses and registered psychiatric nurses (NOC 3012) </li>
                <li>Business development officers and marketing researchers and consultants (NOC 4163). </li>

            <a href=""><h3 class="stu-canvisa-link text-cent">Complete our FREE Express Entry form to see if you are eligible to immigrate to Canada!</h3> </a>
            Invited candidates must have at least one year of work experience in one of the above occupations to be eligible to receive a provincial nomination from the OINP.
<br><br>Those who are successful will receive a provincial nomination from Ontario. They will be able to use the nomination to apply for permanent residence through the Express Entry system. 
<br><br>Express Entry is the system that the federal Canadian government uses to manage permanent residence applications through three main economic class immigration programs: the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), the Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP) and the Canadian Experience Class (CEC). 
<br><br>Candidates are given a Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score based on multiple factors such as their age, work experience, education, language ability and adaptability. 
<br><br>Those with the highest scores are invited to apply for permanent residence in regular Express Entry draws.
<br><br>In many cases such as this one, the Express Entry system is also aligned with provincial immigration programs.
<br><br>If they do receive a nomination, they will be awarded an additional 600 CRS points in the Express Entry system. This means that they can almost guarantee that they will receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence in the next Express Entry draw.
<br><br>The additional 600 CRS points is not specific to this program or to the OINP. Any Express Entry candidate who receives a nomination from any province or territory would be awarded with the additional points.
<br><br>Ontario's Human Capital Priorities stream do not always target the same occupations. The province previously targeted occupations in finance, health, business, among other occupations.
<br><br>In 2020, Ontario invited a total of 6,716 Express Entry candidates to apply for a provincial nomination through the Human Capital Priorities stream.
            <h3>How to immigrate to Ontario?</h3>
            If you wish to immigrate to Ontario and receive an invitation to apply for a provincial nomination, follow these two steps:
<br><br><u> Step 1:</u> Create an Express Entry profile.
<br><br><u> Step 2:</u> If eligible, the OINP will choose you from the Express Entry pool of candidates. You must have shown interest to immigrate to Ontario.

            <h2>Saskatchewan invites 255 immigration candidates in latest PNP draw</h2>
            Saskatchewan held a new draw on June 15, inviting a total of 255 immigration candidates to apply for provincial nomination for permanent residence.
<br><br>Candidates were eligible for a nomination through the International Skilled Worker category through the Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program (SINP).
<br><br>The International Skilled Worker Category is further divided into the Express Entry subcategory as well as the Occupations In-Demand subcategory.
<br><br>A total of 103 immigration candidates were invited through the Express Entry subcategory. Another 152 were invited through the Occupations In-Demand subcategory.
<br><br>Candidates for both of these categories must have submitted an Expression of Interest (EOI) profile with a score of at least 82 EOI points. 
<br><br>In addition, candidates needed an Educational Credential Assessment (ECA) to prove that the foreign credential is equivalent to a Canadian one. 
<br><br>Candidates also needed work experience in one of 55 in-demand occupations. These occupations are listed on this government webpage.
            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            The EOI system is used to select the candidates that would likely be the most successful in the province's labour market. Candidates with EOI profiles are assessed based on multiple factors such as their work experience, education, language ability, age as well as connections to the province.
<br><br>Connections to the province can include having a job offer, or having a relative living in Saskatchewan.
<br><br>Candidates are given a point score out of 100 based on these factors. and according to the International Skilled Worker Points Assessment Grid. The highest scoring candidates are invited to apply for a provincial nomination.

            <h3><b>Saskatchewan Express Entry sub-category</b></h3>
            <p>Canada uses the Express Entry system to manage permanent residence applications through three main economic class immigration programs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) </li>
                <li>Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP) </li>
                <li>Canadian Experience Class (CEC).</li>
            </ul>
            In addition, many provinces also have their own immigration programs that use the Express Entry system. An example of this is the Express Entry sub-category under the Saskatchewan International Skilled Worker category.
<br><br>This sub-category is for immigration candidates interested in immigrating to Saskatchewan, and who also have a federal Express Entry profile.
<br><br>Candidates who are in the federal Express Entry pool, who completed an EOI, and scored 82 on Saskatchewan's Points Assessment Grid, were invited in the latest draw.
<br><br>Express Entry candidates who receive a provincial nomination from Saskatchewan are given an additional 600 points toward their Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score. This practically guarantees receiving an invitation to apply for permanent residence in a subsequent federal Express Entry draw.
            <h3><b>Saskatchewan Occupations In-Demand sub-category</b></h3>
            Saskatchewan invited 152 immigration candidates under the Occupations In-Demand sub-category. 
<br><br>Candidates do not need to have an Express Entry profile to be eligible. This sub-category is for candidates who have work experience in occupations that would address the provinceâ€™s labour shortages. 
<br><br>These candidates would not need to have a job offer to be eligible. Foreign nationals are required to create an EOI profile through the province's online application system. 
<br><br>Those who completed an EOI, meet the minimum requirements and have scored a 82 on the Points Assessment Grid, were invited in the latest draw.
